This program can solve one-dimensional migration equation using DRP scheme and LDDRK scheme.
The Main function: one_dimensional_migration_main.f90
subroutine:DRP7_sub.f90   using optimised 7-points DRP scheme for spatial discretization
	   f_sub.f90      the basic spatial discretized result of one-order patial 
					differential term such as patial_u/patial_x
	   Lax_Wendroff_sub.f90: using the Lax_Wendroff scheme to solve the governing equation
	   LDDRK_sub.f90: the temporal discretized way
